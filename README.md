# Collection of ImageJ scripts.

All scripts in this collection are made ad-hoc in order to perform specific tasks and speed up my image analysis. There is no guarantee that they will work in any other case, however you can modify them to fit your specific needs.

## Background removal
This script is removing background from microscopy images. It works by subtracting background image from all images in a selected folder. The user is asked to select source directory, destination directory and background image. The background image should be taken using the same settings as the rest of the images but without any object. It contain only information about any peripheral darkening (vignetting), spots on the objective and background that are going to be present on all the images. The script will save the cleaned images in a selected destination folder as png files with the same names as original files.
